# Astro Garden

## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This is a work-in-progress project template, designed to speed up the process of publishing a digital garden using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/).
Digital gardens are all about open publication of personal knowledge.
So, in the spirit of this openness, the development of this project is being done "with the garage door open".

### Another reason for openness

I am not a professional web developer.
As such, I expect to make a lot of mistakes while progressing with this project.
While I hope the end result will offer value to others, this project is also a learning opportunity for meâ€”one that I would like to document.
